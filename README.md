The Movies Review app is a fullstack MERN project with a React frontend and a Node backend. Users can browse and search for movies, viewing detailed information like ratings and descriptions via the backend which I hosted on "Dashboard Render". This project demonstrates my expertise in both frontend (React) and backend (MongoDB, Express, Node.js) development, along with API integration, ensuring a responsive and functional movie-browsing experience.
